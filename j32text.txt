With an estimated world population of 111000 giraffes many people do not see these creatures as endangered. There are four distinct species of giraffe with several sub-species. The species are the Masai giraffe, Northern giraffe, Reticulated giraffe and Southern giraffe. The Luangwa giraffe (sometimes called the Thornicroft's giraffe) have an estimated population of only 650 and are critically endangered as are the West African giraffe with an estimated population of 600. This is one of three sub-species of Northern giraffe, with each being classified as endangered or critically endangered. There are fewer than 3000 Northern giraffes remaining. We have arranged a programme to rescue injured or orphaned giraffes, feed them and provide them with medical care until they can be safely released back into the wild with others of the same sub-species. Please support us in our work.
